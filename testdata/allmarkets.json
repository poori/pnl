This market will resolve when the PredictIt market is resolved, to the same outcome.\n\nPredictit Description:\nDuring his first term, President Donald Trump shall grant a pardon to himself for one or more criminal offences, charges or convictions. Such pardon will be considered to have been granted only if Mr. Trump himself appears on the official list of presidential pardons granted by President Trump, maintained by the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of the Pardon Attorney (available upon launch of this market at https://www.justice.gov/pardon/clemencyrecipients) by 11:59 pm on February 15, 2021 (the “End Date”).\n\nA self-pardon for Mr. Trump that is announced but does not appear on such official list by the End Date shall not be sufficient to cause this market to resolve Yes.

The ETH 2 “MIN_GENESIS_TIME” is December 1, 2020, 12pm UTC. If the genesis event doesn’t happen by December 1st, 11:59pm EST, this market will resolve to “No” - and in the unlikely scenario that it happens before November 30th, 11:59pm UTC, the market will also resolve to “No”. The threshold for the genesis event to occur on December 1st is for there to be at least 16,384 32-ETH validator deposits, 7 days prior to December 1st. If the threshold is met, and the genesis event doesn’t happen successfully before resolution time due to unforeseen circumstances, the market will still resolve to “No”. For more information, read this blog post https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/11/04/eth2-quick-update-no-19/ and the hyperlinked smart contract and documentation in it. The resolution source is specified as the official Ethereum blog, but in the case of there not being a definitive answer there, other reputable, on-chain referencing resolution sources would be considered.

    "description": "This is a market on if Donald Trump will be inaugurated for his second term as President of the United States of America, on Inauguration Day—January 20th, 2021. At the time of market creation, AP, CNN, WSJ, Fox, and more have called the election for Joe Biden as the winner, and formally declared him the president-elect, however Trump vows to contest the result legally. \n\nInauguration Day is the day when the newly elected President is sworn in, and takes place at the beginning of every new term, regardless of if it is a new president, or the incumbent president is entering their second term. It has taken place on January 20th every time since 1937, unless it’s been a Sunday, which it is not in 2021. In the highly unlikely event the Inauguration Day date is changed to any other day before February 1st, 2021, it will be treated as the official Inauguration Day and resolution date for this market, and the same conditions will apply. \n\nThis market will not resolve, under any circumstances, until the resolution date—Inauguration Day. If Joe Biden, or anyone else other than Donald Trump, is inaugurated that day as President of the USA, the market will resolve to “No”. If Trump claims he is still president, but is not officially inaugurated on Inauguration Day, the market will resolve to “No”. If for any reason, Trump is not inaugurated for the next term before February 1st, 2021, the market will resolve to “No”. If he is officially inaugurated for his second term on Inauguration Day the market will resolve to \"Yes\". The resolution source will be https://www.usa.gov/presidents#item-37462 and https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/, both official government sources.",

In the unlikely event that theneedledrop does not rate Drake's upcoming album, this market will resolve to 5.\n\nAs this is a Scalar market, you can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with theneedledrop rating.

In the event that Donald Trump does pardon Julian Assange, this will be recorded by the Department of Justice here: https://www.justice.gov/pardon/pardons-granted-president-donald-trump. If the pardon is issued after the specified date, January 21st, 2021, this market will resolve to “No.” This market specifically requires the Presidential pardon to be issued during Donald Trump’s current term in office. In the event of any ambiguity, this market will be resolved in good faith and as intended by the market’s integrity committee.\n\nClarification: If the pardon is not listed by the resolution source on the resolution date, the market will resolve to \"No\". \"Secret pardons\" which are not listed on the website by the resolution date will not satisfy the requirement to resolve to \"Yes\", nor will the resolution date be extended.\n",

Currently, the candidates for this election are Kelly Loeffler on the Republican ticket, and Raphael Warnock on the Democratic ticket.

The linked PredictIt question is the basis for the creation of this market and will be referenced as the leading resolution source, https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/6567/Which-party-will-win-the-US-Senate-special-election-in-Georgia-in-2020 . This market will resolve when the PredictIt market is resolved, to the same outcome.\n\n\nDisclaimer: Likely candidates for each party are listed in the outcome names, however, if for whatever reason the candidates change, this market will be resolved based on the party the winning candidate associates with.\n",

    "description": "This is a market on if the total supply of $YFI, the native token of yearn.finance, will be greater than 30,000 by March 15th, 2021, 4pm EST. Currently there is much debate around adding inflation to the current fixed supply of 30,000 YFI tokens, as a means of creating further incentive for team members and core devs to be committed to the project. If this happens, and the total supply of YFI exceeds 30,000 before the resolution date, the market will resolve to \"Yes\". If the total supply of YFI remains 30,000 on the resolution date, even if a governance proposal set to change that has been approved, the market will resolve to \"No\". If the token gets redeployed and a migration happens, where there is social consensus on a new YFI token that governs yearn.finance, that will be treated as YFI. The main resolution sources will be Coingecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/yearn-finance) and the current ERC20 contract (https://etherscan.io/token/0x0bc529c00c6401aef6d220be8c6ea1667f6ad93e).",

This market will resolve based on the StockX page here: https://stockx.com/air-jordan-1-retro-high-dark-mocha. The average sale price will be calculated using the average of the sales from 12:00 PM EST on December 25th, 2020 till 8 PM EST on December 25th, 2020. The average sale price will be computed by taking the simple average (Sum of sale prices in all sizes divided by number of sales that took place within the time period) based on the sales occurring during the previously defined time window at the webpage listed above. All prices denominated in US Dollar.\n\nAs this is a Scalar market, you can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with the Jordan 1 Mocha's average price on that day. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Donald Trump attends the swearing-in ceremony of Joe Biden's presidential inauguration in person, according to both sources deemed appropriate by the Forecast team, or empirically by watching the inauguration on a livestream. In any case of Donald Trump not attending Joe Biden's official inauguration, the market will resolve to \"No\". In the case that the inauguration takes place in some form of hybrid online/in-person ceremony, if Trump is not physically present at the in-person segment of this, in the same place as Joe Biden, the market resolves to “No.” \n\nIf, for any reason, Biden is not inaugurated, the market will resolve to \"No\". This includes if Trump is inaugurated instead: the market will still resolve to \"No\". The swearing-in ceremony is a publicly televised event and it will be abundantly clear whether or not Donald Trump is present based on the media coverage of inauguration day. Televised video coverage from various outlets will be used to verify his attendance. If no inauguration takes place before February 1st, 2021, this market will resolve to \"No\".

This account detail can be viewed by using a Twitter account to log into the website https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/, searching for @DonaldJTrumpJr, then clicking the verified account labeled \"@DonaldJTrumpJr\" from the search results. Should the total tweets reported by that source at that time appear not to include one or more tweets posted by @DonaldJTrumpJr just before 3:00pm, and still available on that account's timeline at 3:00pm, Polymarket may use additional sources in determining whether any such tweet(s) should be included in the market's resolution. The number by which the total tweets on the resolution date exceeds the Baseline may not equal the number of tweets actually posted over that time period, in light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the fact that the account's total tweets upon launch of the market may differ from the Baseline, tweets may be deleted prior to the resolution date of this market, and specialized tweets such as quotes, retweets, replies, promoted tweets, may or may not be included in that total.\n\nNeither Donald Trump Jr., nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account. Should the resolution source be unavailable at that date and time, for any reason other than deletion, deactivation, or a change in the privacy settings of the account, Polymarket may postpone settlement of this market until the source becomes available. In such a case, the account's total tweets will be measured once Polymarket becomes aware that the source has again become available. If Polymarket deems the source to be permanently unavailable, this market will resolve to \"49 or less\". Should an updated count of total tweets not be available from twitter.com at the date and time of expiration, due to apparent deletion, deactivation, suspension, or a change in privacy settings by a user of the account or by Twitter, this market will resolve to \"49 or less\". The blocking of one or more Twitter accounts by @DonaldJTrumpJr will not be considered to render the settlement source unavailable.\n\nShould the navigation, layout, URL, or labeling of the elements of the settlement source be altered by Twitter or Tweetdeck prior to expiration (other than via deletion or deactivation of the account), this market will still be resolved according to the aforementioned formula, so long as Polymarket can reasonably determine the relevant number of total tweets from twitter.com. The merging, migration, or other combination of one or more Twitter accounts will not in and of itself cause the settlement source to be considered unavailable, so long as an updated count of total tweets can be determined according to the aforementioned formula, even if such combination causes an increase or decrease in that count that does not represent the number of tweets posted to the account during the time period in question.\n\nIn the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

If the election hasn’t been called yet by resolution time, and Trump has not definitively claimed victory, the market will resolve to “No”. If Trump wins and announces it via Tweet before resolution time, the market will resolve to “Yes”. It boils down to Trump tweeting definitively that he successfully won, not that the results are wrong and he should’ve won: it must resemble a victory tweet. This tweet must come from one of his official Twitter accounts, either https://twitter.com/POTUS or\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump and does not include Retweets.

Filing for divorce, in the context of this market, can be defined empirically as either an official announcement directly from either Kim or Kanye that they're getting divorced, or an official filing of divorce, including but not limited to certified copies of divorce decrees available from the Superior Court in the county where the decree was granted. This market will resolve \"Yes\" if the aforementioned conditions are met and \"No\" otherwise. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).\n",
